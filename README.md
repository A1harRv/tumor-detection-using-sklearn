# tumor-detection-using-sklearn
I built a tumor detection classifier using logistic regression, but instead of focusing on model complexity, I focused on decision-making. I showed that the default 0.5 threshold is not suitable for medical diagnosis, and demonstrated how lowering the threshold improves recall while accepting higher false positives.
